Student academic performance classification with neural network

# About the project
This is a multi-class classification task on studentsâ€™ performances. I use variety of models on this dataset for improving the performance.
For example:

* Using different layer size and different numbers of neurons in Dense layers.
* Using Dropout
* Using Batc hNormalization

This is one my project of Deep Learning course at University of Guilan in winter 2022.
## Evaluation

For Evaluating of each model, there is classification report and loss and accuracy plot.
Finally, best models were evaluated by K-fold.

## Dataset

  The dataset contains informatation about students like: place of birth, raise hand, discussion, etc.
